SOS4 Structure Model Summary

1. Raw SOS

Core, unwrapped token representing the “true” SOS.

Acts as the underlying asset for wrapped SOS derivatives.

Owner control is strong and immutable: raw SOS cannot be forcibly seized or transferred by others.

Provides a backing mechanism for wrapped SOS.


2. Wrapped SOS

Tradable token representing raw SOS in a derivative form.

Can be freely transferred on markets.

Minting is allowed only up to the available balance in raw SOS (prevents oversupply).

Includes a bonus mint incentive for users minting wrapped SOS.


3. Dual-Layer System

Layer 1: Raw SOS (base, secure, immutable).

Layer 2: Wrapped SOS (flexible, tradable, bonus-enabled).

Lineage & Trust Verification: Wrapped SOS references the raw SOS lineage to maintain integrity and prevent mint bypass.

Optional recursive lineage aggregation for tracking historical balances across SOS generations.


4. Stability Mechanisms

Two-layer wrapped SOS stability: safeguards the system from extreme volatility or minting abuse.

Ethereum gas cost-backed: minting and stability functions are tuned to ETH gas cost considerations.

Time-based minting: last stage or bonus stability mechanisms can be triggered or time-locked.


5. Economic Incentives

Bonus minting encourages liquidity in wrapped SOS while keeping raw SOS secure.

Lineage-based trust system ensures wrapped SOS can be verified and prevents fraudulent over-minting.


This structure essentially creates a hybrid system:

Raw SOS → secure, immutable store of value.

Wrapped SOS → tradable, bonus-incentivized token, lineage-verified for integrity.

Dual-layer design → ensures economic stability, trust, and controlled minting while allowing free market operations.
