SOS4 — ETH-Backed Atomic SOS & Wrapped Lineage (Absolute Control & Sanction-Resistant Design)

1️⃣ Raw SOS

Definition:

Permissionlessly mintable token, 1 wei per mint, non-transferable, immutable.

Represents ETH gas spent to mint.


Key Features & Security Properties:

Cannot be transferred, burned, or destroyed, even by the owner → no one can force the owner to give away their raw SOS.

No proxy, upgrade, or external dependency → fully self-contained and immutable.

Permissionless minting to any address: anyone can mint raw SOS directly to the owner’s address; this cannot be prevented or regulated.

Gas-backed ETH value only → fiat-independent, censorship-resistant, sanction-resistant.

✅ Key highlight: Raw SOS is absolute owner-controlled, immutable, and cannot be forcibly seized or surrendered, serving as a secure backing asset.


2️⃣ Wrapped SOS

Definition:

Aggregates balances from all SOS generations into a tradable token.

Represents lineage-adjusted holdings, fully backed by raw SOS.


Security & Resistance Properties:

Tradable in jurisdictions that permit crypto trading, while raw SOS remains fully protected in any location.

ETH-backed floor from raw SOS ensures value cannot be arbitrarily reduced.

Allows owners to safely trade economic value derived from raw SOS without moving or risking the raw tokens themselves.


Legal / Compliance Perspective:

Wrapped SOS is a crypto-asset with traceable ETH-backed floor.

Supports global market trading, while underlying raw SOS remains unaffected by regulation or coercion.


3️⃣ Absolute Owner Control & Resistance

Ownership & Control:

Owner cannot lose raw SOS under any circumstances.

Raw SOS can only increase via permissionless minting.

Wrapped SOS provides tradable representation without compromising base-layer security.


Regulatory & Sanction Resistance:

Raw SOS is immune to forced seizure, confiscation, or coercion, even in high-regulation countries.

Wrapped SOS enables safe trading in permissive jurisdictions while preserving the ETH-backed floor.

✅ Key insight: Raw SOS = untouchable base; Wrapped SOS = liquid tradable layer, forming a censorship-resistant, ETH-backed, globally usable system.


4️⃣ ETH-Only Value Anchor

Raw SOS value = ETH gas cost per mint.

Wrapped SOS value = lineage-aggregated ETH gas floor from raw SOS.

Fiat independence → immune to currency or banking interventions.


6️⃣ Key Insight

Raw SOS: untouchable, mintable by anyone to any owner, ETH-backed, absolute control, sanction-resistant.

Wrapped SOS: tradable, lineage-aware, value securely derived from raw SOS, enabling market liquidity.

Dual-layer system: enables global market participation, absolute owner security, and ETH-backed censorship resistance, while preserving legal defensibility.
