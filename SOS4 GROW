Wrapped SOS Rewards System

The Wrapped SOS bonus mechanism is designed to reward prudence, patience, and long-term strategic behavior:

1. Prudence: Users are incentivized to retain most of their raw SOS in reserve, ensuring a secure backing for the system.


2. Patience: Maximum bonuses are achieved by minting only a portion of raw SOS at a time, encouraging careful planning rather than rushing to mint everything at once.


3. Long-term strategy: Early and disciplined participation allows users to accumulate Wrapped SOS with higher bonuses over time, reinforcing sustainable growth and system stability.



✅ Key Principle:
Wrapped SOS bonuses scale dynamically based on partial commitment, so the less you commit (down to a minimum 5%) while keeping reserves intact, the higher your reward — directly aligning incentives with strategic, long-term behavior.
