SOS-A-New-Global-Cryptographic-Notary
SOS (Secure Operations Signature), a cryptographic system that provides immutable proof of payment and economic action.   SOS works with any payment method, does not store value, and replaces traditional escrow or notarization, making transactions secure, verifiable, and corruption-resistant.

Creator Rights & Code Versioning
The SOS system is created and owned by the Founder, who approves all commercial licensing, receives royalties or license fees, and can audit third-party deployments for compliance. Public access is limited to research, testing, or audit; commercial deployment requires authorization.
SOS follows strict version control for security and traceability. Official releases are tagged (v1.0, v1.1, etc.), and only the Swiss licensing entity or approved contributors can produce production-ready releases. Public releases are read-only and cannot be deployed commercially without a license, and all changes are logged and verifiable.
