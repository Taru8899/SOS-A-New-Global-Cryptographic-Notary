Deploying and using SOS in a mix of online deployment + offline local nodes, tailored for areas like Transnistria:


---

Step 0 — Preconditions

You have Solidity code for SOS (mint-only, non-transferrable, proof-of-action).

You have access to a machine that can deploy an Ethereum contract online.

Offline users have access to local Ethereum nodes or private testnets (even LAN-based).



---

Step 1 — Deploy the Original SOS Online

1. Choose a public Ethereum network (mainnet or testnet for experimentation).


2. Deploy the SOS contract using the original Solidity code:

Set name_ and symbol_.

Set previousController_ = address(0) (first deployment).



3. Record the contract address and the controller (deployer) address.



✅ This creates the official, public reference SOS contract.

All offline instances will eventually reference this address as previousController.



---

Step 2 — Setup Local Offline Nodes

Each group can run a local Ethereum node or private testnet:

Geth / Besu / Nethermind or Ganache / Hardhat local blockchain.

No Internet required for minting SOS locally.


Each offline node deploys its own SOS contract:

Set previousController_ = <original online SOS contract>

This maintains lineage so offline SOS tokens are cryptographically linked to the global chain.




---

Step 3 — Mint SOS Offline

1. Local users generate wallets (addresses).


2. Mint SOS to other addresses only:

mint(address recipient)


3. Transactions are stored on the local blockchain ledger.


4. Recipients can verify proof entirely offline by inspecting the local chain.



✅ No Internet, no bank, no ID needed.


---

Step 4 — Periodic Online Synchronization

1. When possible, connect the offline node to the Internet.


2. Use a bridge or aggregator script to:

Extract offline SOS transactions.

Submit them to the public online SOS contract as proof.



3. Optional: deploy helper contracts or scripts that replicate offline SOS mints to the main contract while keeping original timestamps and addresses intact.



This synchronizes local activity with the global ledger while keeping autonomy.



---

Step 5 — Verification

Anyone can verify SOS tokens using:

Local ledger (offline proof)

Public contract (online proof, synchronized periodically)


The lineage reference (previousController) ensures trust across offline and online deployments.



---

Step 6 — Repeat

Offline groups continue minting SOS to recipients.

Occasionally, they synchronize to the public chain to maintain global verifiability.

The SOS system thus becomes a hybrid offline-online proof-of-action network.



---

Visual Summary of Workflow

1. Online deployment → Original SOS contract


2. Offline groups → Deploy local SOS referencing previousController


3. Offline minting → Mint for recipients


4. Optional sync → Push offline mints to online contract periodically


5. Verification → Local ledger or online contract

Important Notes

Gas for offline minting: If using a local private network, gas can be fake/minimal for testing.

Global proof requires syncing: Offline-only activity will not appear in public verifiable history until synchronized.

Security: Offline nodes must be trusted by the group; if compromised, offline proof could be manipulated before syncing.
